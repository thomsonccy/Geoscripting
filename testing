A description of the data you would like to use for your final project:

We are interested in plant species recognition from drone or satellite images.
The input we need would be the images and information to help us recognize the species.


Is the data available?
Yes, for most regions satellite images would be easy to get. For drone images it could be more difficult in some regions. 
The information to help us recognize the species is uncertain.

What type of data would you like to visualise/analyse?
Geo-referenced images of a certain area, characteristics of plant such as physical properties under different polarisation, indices, colour.
